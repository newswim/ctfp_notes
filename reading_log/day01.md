1.1 Arrows as functions

> The essence of a category is _composition_, or if you prefer, the essence
> of composition is a category.

If there is a object (A), another object (B), and a third object (C), and
if there is an arrow from A to B, and another from B to C then
**THERE MUST BE** an arrow from A to C. That's what we mean by composition.
