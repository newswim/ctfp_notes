# How does one eat an elephant?

## Intro

The author makes a pun in the preface, pointing out how us
software engineers are likely to already view our time as a premium, asking
why it is we would want to learn an obscure branch of mathematics with those
precious fleeting minutes.

Good question. As the mathematician Eugenia Cheng, another notable expert in the
field pointed out in one of her talks at Lambda World called,
_Category Theory in Life_, understanding Category Theory at almost any level
helps to think about practically any other logical system. This means category
theory is, as she puts it,

> The logical study of
>      the logical study of
>         how logical things work.

So if "mathematics is the language of the universe", then category theory is
the meta-language that underwrites that tongue.


## Accountability

I have ADD. Or something to that effect, what is attention any way? You know
I listened to a podcast recently where (... _trails off for 15 minutes_)

where was I?

Yes. So, getting through a book is difficult for me. Much less a 500-page book
in a field that I barely know anything about, with examples in a language that
I don't know, in time that I don't have.

It's then reasonable for me to outline some kind of _goals_, so that way I
can at least track where I'm at, and keep me hopefully engaged and within the
bounds of some target area. I don't have particularly well worded goals yet,
but for now....

#### Goals

- Read 15 minutes of CTFP a day
- Keep a reading log
- Transcribe code examples


#### Chapters

See CHAPTERS.md
